## Plan


We login on bank acc with mail/password, on the website.
When we wants to access wallet we need password and token.
This token is on the app.

He has to be logged on the app to access the token.


Access wallet:

SCHEME 2.4

Send password from the Browser to the server, which is valid or not
If it's valide, the server send a token to the smartphone from the databse

Then he needs to access the app on the smartphone
And send the token to the website
